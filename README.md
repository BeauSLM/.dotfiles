# .dotfiles

This is the repo containing all my dotfiles. Basically just me learning how to
configure stuff on youtube and trying it here lul.

# How I use it

I simply clone in my home directory, and run the `arch` script. It uses GNU-stow
to symlink every file in the appropriate location - see the `stow_folder` for
the placement of my config files.
